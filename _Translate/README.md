# _Translate
React Wordpress Microsite plugin for filtering posts by language for a given user. When a user clicks the link for a translated article, that language is stored as their preferred language.

## Installation
From the command line, run `react-wp --plugin --install _TSWTips`.
Once installed, select `Y` when prompted to activate.

Then, manually copy the `public/translate.js` file from the plugin to the `public/scripts` directory in your project.
